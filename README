                             The DifSets Package

The DifSets Package implements an algorithm for enumerating all difference sets
up to equivalence in an arbitrary finite group. The algorithm functions by
finding difference sums, which are potential images of difference sets in
quotient groups of the original group, and searching their preimages. In this
way, the search space can be dramatically decreased, and searches of groups of
relatively large order (such as order 64 or order 96) can be completed.


                                Requirements

The package requires at least version 4.5 of GAP and version 1.3 of GAPDoc.


                                Installation

The DifSets package is not distributed with a standard installation of GAP. To
install, first acquire the archive at

    https://github.com/dylanpeifer/difsets/archive/v2.0.0.tar.gz

and then unpack the archive in the pkg directory of one of the GAP root
directories. No external binaries need to be compiled. After installation, the
package can be loaded at the GAP command prompt by typing

    gap> LoadPackage("DifSets");

after which the DifSets banner should appear on the screen.


                                Documentation

Documentation for the DifSets package can be found in the  "doc" subdirectory
in html form as "chap0.html" and pdf form as "manual.pdf".


                                Results

Results for the group with ID [v, n] in the SmallGroups library are found in
the file "v-n.txt" in the directory "data/groups/v". At the top of each file is
a header with the ID of the group, the total number of inequivalent difference
sets found, and the time required for the computation. For example, the group
SmallGroup(64, 260) has 30 difference sets up to equivalence. These sets can be
found in the file "data/groups/64/64-260.txt". The header of this file
indicates that the computation took 25 hours, 51 minutes, and 42.956 seconds to
complete.

The script "difsets", also available in the "data" subdirectory, was used to
produce the result files. Calling

    ./difsets v n

will start a session of GAP, load the DifSets package, and compute the list of
inequivalent difference sets in SmallGroup(v, n). Output is then put in the
file "v-n.txt". For example,

    ./difsets 16 4

produces the file "16-4.txt" that contains all the inequivalent difference sets
in group [16, 4].
